In this project I will attempt to write a daemon that uses the linux dirtycow exploit to covertly install a rootkit behind the scenes.

I will assume that it is first possible to run the daemon on a target system.

I want the daemon to do the following:

-add itself to linux startup daemons so that it is persistent across startups

-create a checklist of rootkit tasks

-periodically attempt dirtycow exploit to do the checklist tasks

-keep track of progress, continue where it left off if there is a reboot

-when finished installing the rootkit, erase any trace that it was there
